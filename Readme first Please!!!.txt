Manual to use the System

1. Install the following Packages

Client					Server
==========                           ===========
npx create-react-app .		     npm init
npm install bootstrap                npm install mysql2 express body-parser
npm install react-router-dom         cors 

2. Registering

   *When registering, after clicking the submit button
     wait a little bit of time to make the message poping-up success
     the reason why it take a second to register, its because of Device compatibility, low quality specs
     or its because of the (gif) bg running in our system making our device lagging

3. Rank

     *When your already in the Rank component pages and you want to view the details of the person 
     individually or want to update it, just click the "View" button to show the detail

4. Enjoy The Show!!!
